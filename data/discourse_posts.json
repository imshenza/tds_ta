      "23f1002231\n23d\n@s.anand\n@carlton\nSir i am done with my api endpoint for project 1 but i did one change in the given test file where we have to edit our api endpoint and test it as mentioned in the project description. I was testing my model but was getting the same response every time even though my model was giving the expected answer to those question when tested separately. I found that in the test file (promptfoo.yaml) the cache is marked as true and because of which whenever i try to run the test file it does not hit my api endpoint and take the old response from the cache. So i changed the cache to false and tried running that test file and got the results as shown below in the image.\nimage\n1861×912 105 KB\nIn this as you can see for the 2nd test case since i am using the openai model to give the final answer so it is using my context and saying that dashboard will show 11/10, but the expected answer should contain “110”. The problem i am facing is as you can see the url given in my response is same as expected which means my model is picking the right context to answer the question but since i am using openai to make my final answer using this context it is very unlikely that it will say that dashboard will show “110” because this doesn’t make sense. So can you please help me how should i tackle this ? As this is the only test case left.\nAnd also i have added one prompt field in the test file because i was getting warning regarding this missing field again and again.

With just GA it would be difficult to assess.\n2 Replies\n14\n​\n​\nReply",
      "Anand\nDec 2021\nApart from what\n@CKPIITM\nobserved about this course, here’s my first impression of this course…Granted, it has been only a week, but I think I must go ahead anyway…\nThe week-1 clearly shows a lack of planning, from the program as well as the specific course perspective.  It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard.  The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point.  What’s the context and the motivation?  Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text.  Can’t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker.  Neither does give me much understanding anyway.  It was filled with terminology that I’m yet to pick up.  The speaker didn’t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.\nSummary.  I feel the course is offered too early.  Rather, I took it a little too early.\nDefinitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about.  At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program.  I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how.\nSorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one.  I just had to.  I’m willing to hear different opinions.\nI’m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.\n2 Replies\n10\n​\n​\nReply",
      "CKPIITM\nDec 2021\nI am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME.\nHopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.\n1 Reply\n2\n​\n​\nReply",
      "fml\nAnand\nDec 2021\nI feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses. From the offset, there are people who don’t know what modelling is, the different kinds of models etc. but there is no explanation for all this. Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation.\nBut I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only “comprehension” type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay.\n2\n​\n​\nReply",
      "Anand\nDec 2021\nAs of now, I’m set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week.  Will continue after all other ML courses are done…\n3\n​\n​\nReply",

As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.\n4\n​\n​\nReply",
      "CKPIITM\nDec 2021\nParticipants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary.

      "Anand\nDec 2021\nwell, my choice of dropping might be wrong…but, guided by the following factors.\nThe recording was perhaps done much earlier as\n@CKPIITM\npointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would’ve been already recorded.  So, lesser chances to re-record them.\nThere are no live sessions planned yet for this course… the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it’s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.\nFinally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.\n2\n​\n​\nReply",
      "CKPIITM\nDec 2021\nImagine if your reason doesn’t get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don’t think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material.\n@Anand\n2\n​\n​\nReply",

      "maheshbalan\nCourse_Team\nJan 2022\nHey guys, thank you everyone for voicing out your opinions and perspective in a healthy manner. I really appreciate it. I understand it might start to sound like greek and latin for some of you, but we intentionally made the decision to have ML foundations as co-requisite. Because you can learn the theory and try to visit back and connect with the practice (tools) part. Some pointers which could be helpful for all of you having different perspectives (both positive and negative) -\nWhat is the benefit of this course? - passing this course would definitely make you industry ready. And Anand S, who himself is a very accomplished Data Scientist wanted to give the real flavour of how you would be working in Industry (no spoon-feeding, but giving you directions). Most examinations will be open book, open internet or take home.\nWe will share all the resources (codes, excel, etc.). You can download those supplementary materials from the drive link in course contents page.\nThere will be youtube live sessions every week and the calendar will be shared soon. Please used these live sessions if you need more help or guidance.\nAll the instructors in this course are well accomplished data scientists working in industry and most of them also teach in different IITs/IIMs as faculty. So my humble request is to give them all a bit of respect as some of you are bluntly rude.\nDefinitely this course will be different from other courses because this is going to be an applied course and the idea is to make you know the different quantum of things we could do in data science. I do not think you would be Industry ready unless you get comfortable with this course honestly. Because this is the reality, this is how things are going to be once you interview for or get onboarded as DS.\nThe materials and case studies are so meticulously curated just for the purpose this course in the past 8 months. They are so valuable and try to explore use the help of live sessions to get your issues sorted out.\nUse the Youtube live sessions to the fullest those whoever need more help with this course. We would be more than happy to help. Let’s respect each other and that’s a fair expectation I guess. Thanks!\n17\n​\n​\nReply",

We don’t know how industry will judge at first, with marks, excitement, ability to learn new things and many other parameters, so when we watch video we expect it to moving around questions being asked.\nIt is like we\noverfit ourselves to video content\n, but\nunderfit the assignment content\n. So some\nregularisations\n, you as a team have to add to make it just\nright fit\n.\nWhether it’s\n@Anand\nor people like me, who themselves are teachers for more than a decade, can see the gap more profound than others and are vocal at the same time.\nTrust us we are the one who reverses our opinions if things are started to get fine tuned without any hesitation or apprehension.\nAnd surely, we are not doubting the intent of IITM, they are for sure imparting best of knowledge to mere mortals like us. We are just fortunate in many ways and thankful to IITM.\nTake our responses just as feedback. And make this course truly world class.\n5\n​\n​\nReply",

I was not given an updated enrollment list of students on the course, so although we have your submission scores it was not pushed to the dashboard because as far as I was aware you were not on TDS enrollment list that was provided to us by operations\n@jkmadathil\n. We will make the corrections and inform operations. It will take a few days to get sorted out.\nThanks for letting us know and for your patience.\nKind regards\nTDS Team\nSolution\n​\n​\nReply"

      "vanshbordia\n28d\nFor the GA2, its better to submit all at once as a lot of the answer changes based on the time & duration from last run, as well as you need to make sure that the local servers are running. Token & codesapces timeout after a certain period and you need to redo those.\nEasiest way is to do till q8 one by one and anytime you like they are persistent, and for all the rest try to do them at a sitting and don’t close any of the servers (local apis, codespace, ngrok) till all submit\n2\n​\n​\nReply",

      "Advaith52\nJivraj\n18d\nA related question: For the FastAPI server (question 10), I get one mark for putting in the URL when the server is up and running. However, if I stop the server and move on to answering other questions, and then try submitting again, I lose that 1 mark.\nDo I have to have the server running for this question every time I submit? Shouldn’t I be given the 1 mark after getting it right the first time?\n​\n​\nReply",

      "Kratikajain\n18d\nIssue with GA 2 Submissions and Session Errors\nDear\n@s.anand\nand\n@carlton\nI hope you’re doing well.\nI wanted to let you know that I have completed all the questions in GA 2. Most of them involve using FastAPI, which I’ve been running locally on\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/\n. However, I’ve been facing some issues with the platform while submitting the answers.\nSpecifically, for questions involving Google Authentication and Vercel, the system initially told me the answers were correct, but when I revisited them later, I received errors like “session expired” or similar messages. This happened with Questions 12, 11, 10, and 6. Since these questions often required different local sessions or saving work separately, I ended up losing progress or getting lower marks despite having completed them.\nFrom my side, I’ve solved every question. The issue seems to be related to how the platform handles sessions and saves progress across different parts of the assignment. Could you please advise me on how to proceed or if there’s a way to ensure my work is properly counted?\nThank you for your help!\nBest regards,\nKratika Jain\n​\n​\nReply",
      "carlton\nRegular\n18d\nHi Kratika,\nThe way to deal with questions that require the server or service to be live while submitting, is to leave those questions till the last and answer all the other questions first. Then turn on those services and submit those remaining questions so that you are able to get the full marks for the GA.\nPlease remember that your last save will be your official score. So make sure that the last save in the part where you reload is your best score.\nGod bless,\nCarlton D’Silva\n1\n​\n​\nReply",

      "22f3001416\n13d\nRealizing the Value of Collaboration\nAs I’ve been going through this course, one thing that’s really started to make sense to me is how important collaboration is. None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine.\nI’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.\nThis course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning.\nif somebody feels the same  then Reply , Thankyou\n1 Reply\n1\n​\n​\nReply",

I saw the GA1 quiz content and there are many topics that I don’t know, there are videos pertaining to every question that we can watch and then solve the problems. So, my question is if we had to watch a video to solve the problem for most of them and were able to solve most of the problems should I consider taking the course or if I had to see the videos for most of the questions I should drop the course.

      "23f2004661\nMay 9\nHello there,\nThe course content was released today, and I saw the first GA1 that asks us to solve a quiz so that we can know where we stand and make a decision on whether we should take the course now or later. I saw the GA1 quiz content and there are many topics that I don’t know, there are videos pertaining to every question that we can watch and then solve the problems. So, my question is if we had to watch a video to solve the problem for most of them and were able to solve most of the problems should I consider taking the course or if I had to see the videos for most of the questions I should drop the course. I’d like to ask the same question for GA2\n@s.anand\n@carlton\n@iamprasna\n@Jivraj\n1\n​\n​\nReply",

There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.\nKind regards\n1\n​\n​\nReply"

    "posts": [
      "Meikanda_Sivam\n15d\nI Kindly need Help with LLM CLI Tool –  Model Authentication Issue with Models other OpenAI models.\nI’ve been trying to go a bit deeper into Module 1 after completing GA1, and I’ve encountered some issues while experimenting with the\nllm\nCLI tool and different models.\nSpecifically, I tried running the following command to test the Gemini model, as shown on the Module 3 introduction page:\nllm\n'What is 2 + 2?'\n-m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\nBut I received the following error:\nError\n:\nError\ncode\n:\n401\n- {\n'error'\n: {\n'message'\n:\n'No auth credentials found'\n,\n'code'\n:\n401\n}}\nInitially, I had set my OpenAI key from AIPipe , but I got a “model not found” error. So I checked the available models using:\nllm model list\nAt that point, the Gemini model wasn’t listed.\nI then installed the\nllm-openrouter\nplugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list.
